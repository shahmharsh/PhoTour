Intuitive Image search

Designed and developed an intuitive image search android app over flickr, that took in voice input of a phrase,
generated keywords from it, searched over flickr to provide 9 most relevant images. The user could then click on the
most relevant image, to produce 9 new images, that followed the original keywords, plus tags specific to the selected
pic. In this way, the app would always provide more relevant photos to the user and it is possible to search for
extremely specific photos with extremely generic queries like "that sunny beach in san diego".

This is code is written during the Yahoo! Hackathon.
